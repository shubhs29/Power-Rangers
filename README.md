## 🧠 Problem Statement

Households in India are unknowingly wasting significant amounts of electricity due to inefficient usage patterns, lack of awareness, and absence of actionable insights. This contributes to:

- Higher electricity bills
- Increased carbon footprint
- Overload on national grids during peak hours

Yet, homeowners lack easy-to-understand tools to monitor usage and improve behavior.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Build a Smart AI Assistant that:
- Accepts simulated energy usage data (via CSV or mock API)
- Analyzes usage patterns and detects inefficiencies using ML
- Provides personalized, actionable tips using LLMs like GPT
- Displays interactive dashboards and KPIs to visualize impact
- Adds *gamification* (points, badges, leaderboard) to motivate users

> Example Tip:  
> "Running your washing machine post-10 PM could save ₹150/month."
